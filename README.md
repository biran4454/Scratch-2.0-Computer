## Scratch-2.0-Computer

PLEASE NOTE: THIS IS AN OLD PROJECT. IT WILL ONLY WORK ON SCRATCH.

A computer program made on Scratch 2.0
Please download Scratch 2.0 here: https://scratch.mit.edu/download/scratch2 .
This project does not work in Scratch 3.0 yet.
Thanks.

STARTUP NOTES:
Start the program.
Move your mouse while it is starting up because there is a bug.
Enter 'N' when it asks you if you want to enter compiling code.
It will display a photo and a message saying 'log in'. Click or press a key and it will unlock and show a welcome screen.
From now on it is a lot like Windows (with the exception of a start menu; I'm still working on that). 
Read the help in the bottom right corner. It is a blue circle with 'i' on it.
